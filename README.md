# dc-Tables-Pagination

 
The problem was how to paginate ( and format) d3 data.tables to display the results of the cross-filtering. 
If I have, let say 3,000 filtered records , but I do not want only 100 records to be displayed on the one page, and rest on the other pages. 
The documentation on this subject was very limited.

However with the help of the Balaji Veeraraghavan, we came up with the very elegant solution to this problem.

To implement more than one filter please check the code at our page
